# LodeStar

Allows the creation of items that are bound to named destinations.
An extension of the SpawnStar plugin, but not just for spawn anymore!
You can set a destination, similar to warps, and then bind any item to that 
destination so that when used, it will teleport the player to the destination.

## Features

*  A fully configurable item that teleports a player to preset destinations. Default item is a netherstar, but can be changed to any item.
*  Includes all the functionality of SpawnStars, and a whole lot more!
*  Customizable display name and lore.
*  Option to teleport back to overworld spawn from nether or the end.
*  Configurable cool down period.
*  Configurable warm up period, with optional particle effects during warm up.
*  Individually configurable options to cancel teleport during warmup on damage, movement, or block interaction.
*  Configurable option to remove item from inventory on use, after successful teleport, or never.
*  Configurable option to prevent using LodeStar items in crafting recipes.
*  Configurable option to require shift-click to use.
*  Configurable per message repeat delay (message cooldown) where appropriate.
*  Customizable language support.
